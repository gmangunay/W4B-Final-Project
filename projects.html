            <h2> Robotics Project – TI-RSLK MAX Maze Solver </h2>
            <p>Developed an obstacle avoiding algorithm on the Texas Instruments Robotics <br> Learning Kit.
               There were three GP2Y0A21YK0F Infrared sensors untilized <br> for the obstacle avoidance. 
               Applied different duty cycles for each PWM motor <br> depending on which sensors were triggered.
               All of this was done inside the Code <br>Composer Studio IDE as it was neccessary to access the
               on-board chips. Prior to <br>the completion of the project, I also worked on many path-planning 
               algorithms <br> such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A* on MATLAB.

            <h2>Data Acquisition Project – Non-Contact Temperature Gun </h2>
            <p>
                Converted a Nerf blaster into a temperature reading non-contact device. The <br> component responsible 
                for reading the target's temperature is the MLX90614 <br> Infrared sensor. The readings become inaccurate
                if the sensor are outside of <br> the optimal range. To combat this, I implemented a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
                <br>to calculate the distance from the target. An LCD screen displays target <br>temperatures along with distance
                if the user is too far away. Features such as <br>LED indicators and a laser diode are also installed for target
                acquisition and usability.<br> All of this is powered through an Arduino Nano and wasdeveloped on the Arduino IDE.

            <h2>Senior Project - LED Electronic Ariel Flare (L.E.A.F)</h2>
            <p>
                Designed an autonomous drone that when deployed simulates an advanced becaon <br> of distress by emitting morse code.
                Created our own dedicated flight controller module<br> through an Arduino Nano microcontroller as our drone would only
                serve the purpose of <br>being deployed during an emergency (no recreational use). Implemented 18650 Lithium-ion<br> batteries
                to power the 4 brushless motors installed. The Adafruit 9-dof Aboslute Orientation <br>IMU Fusion Breakout was another
                key component in this project as it allowed us to calculate<br> the roll, pitch, and yaw of the drone. The whole frame 
                was contructed by 3D printing in order<br> to save on cost and weight of the project. Project was halted due to the start of the pandemic.
